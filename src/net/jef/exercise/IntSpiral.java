/**
 * Coding Exercise for stated problem:
 *
 * Write some code that accepts an integer and prints the integers from 0 to that input integer in a spiral format.
 *
 * For example, if I supplied 24 the output would be:
 *
 *      20  21  22  23  24
 *      19  6   7   8   9
 *      18  5   0   1   10
 *      17  4   3   2   11
 *      16  15  14  13  12
